# ü™¢ Ropecoin

Welcome to the official Ropecoin repo. This is where all the chaos lives ‚Äî token smart contracts, frontend code, and a community‚Äôs last degen hope before the market pulls the floor.

Ropecoin is a decentralized memecoin born in the ashes of modern finance ‚Äî a last-ditch bet for the terminally degen. Built on the Internet Computer (ICP), Ropecoin fuses meme culture with multichain tech using Chain Key and Chain Fusion.

> It's not salvation. It's resignation ‚Äî in style.

## üåê About

Ropecoin isn't just a coin ‚Äî it's a statement. One that says:

- "Yes, I read the whitepaper (no I didn't)."
- "Yes, I YOLO'd everything into a coin named after rope."
- "Yes, I deserve to touch grass."

## ü§ù Contribute

We welcome contributors who are fluent in:

- Web3 dark humor
- Frontend development
- Rust smart contracts
- Charity integration, mental health support, or financial recovery services

### Guidelines

1. **Don't be a jerk** - We're all degens here, but be nice
2. **Write tests** - We actually care about quality
3. **Follow the code style** - Keep it pretty, and use the [Examples.tsx](src/frontend/src/components/Examples.tsx) file for frontend inspiration
4. **Add comments** - Future you will thank present you
5. **Update docs** - If you break something, document it

### Process

1. Fork the repo (if you haven't already)
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request and detail your changes
6. Complain to deaf ears when no one reviews it and it gets lost in the abyss

### What We're Looking For

- Bug fixes (because obviously)
- Utility and games (let's keep it entertaining)
- Performance improvements (faster = better)
- UI/UX enhancements (pretty pixels matter)
- Documentation improvements (because reading is hard)
- Meme suggestions (we're serious about this)
